# Kupon Protocol: How To Contribute?

Kupon Protocol is being developed by the Kupon community, a self-organizing group of people. The Kupon community mostly coordinates through [Discord](https://discord.gg/TjTZaCZ4wY) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Kupon-Protocol).

## How can you participate?

### Developing the concept / project architecture

Even if it sounds techie, developing the project concept/architecture is not limited to coders only. Anyone can think about how the protocol should work, what are the possible usage scenarios, what features are needed, what kind of disputes can occur etc., and share their ideas with others.

Try to use graphic tools like diagrams to get your points across more efficiently.

### Coding

Check the Kupon Protocol's GitHub account and [examine smart contracts](https://github.com/Kupon-Protocol/kupon-protocol-contracts) and the front-end code. It's very likely Kupon will have many different front-ends for various use cases. Try to figure out how you can help, discuss ideas with existing devs, and push PRs.

The lowest hanging fruits are writing smart contract **tests** for edge cases and missing scenarios. Another very welcome contribution is **looking for bugs** and trying to "break" the protocol in order to then improve it.

**Gas optimizations** are another important part of writing smart contracts. Examine how a differently written code can affect gas performance and propose an optimized code through a pull request.

**Pull requests:** shorter pull requests (less code) are more preferred than PRs with a bunch of changes and features all in one.

### UX/UI

Think how user experience can be improved with a better UI, different element positioning, etc. You don't need to be a graphic designer to see how UX can be improved. But if you are one, you can help with graphic design, too.

We mostly use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/wvsOnXrcH7g2MvP7qv8n86) for UX/UI, but we're open to other tools too.

### Marketing and community management

If we want the Kupon protocol to be widely used, we need to tell people about it. Think about the ways to do that (without spamming, of course) and discuss ideas with other Kupon community members.

Community management is also very important, particularly in chats like Discord. This consists of answering questions, introducing newcomers to the protocol, helping each other, and reporting spammers and scammers. All while being respectful and kind to each other.

### Other

There are other ways to participate in the community, so if you think of any, share it with others and bring it to life! :)

## Be proactive

In order to successfully participate in the community, you need to be proactive. Of course, it's nothing wrong to be just an observer and occasionally provide feedback, but if you want to be an **active participant**, you need to figure a TODO task yourself, not wait for someone to give it to you.

Voice your ideas and opinions frequently and use graphic materials (like diagrams) to make your points more clear. But don't expect every idea to be accepted and implemented. With many active members come many (different) opinions, so it's only natural that most ideas don't end up being implemented/used. But these ideas still shape the ones that pass through, so they are not irrelevant.

## DAO in the making

Kupon is a DAO in the making, and similar to other DAOs, we are also still figuring out how to properly self-organize and work together in a decentralized fashion. So besides being proactive we also need to be **patient** with each other.

Just like web applications are now a necessary part of almost any company (even though 25 years ago many didn't agree), both fungible and non-fungible tokens will be an integral part of our economy in the future. Within that, a proper protocol for issuing coupons and vouchers is needed, so let's be the ones to build it! :)
